-- Vivid venue split: take the LAST " - ", not the first.
--
-- Found by sampling every unmapped surface (2026-09-14). mig 20260911230000 introduced the
-- split of Vivid's single `venue` string on its trailing " - City, ST" suffix, and wrote the
-- leading group non-greedy (`.*?`). Non-greedy anchors the split at the FIRST " - " in the
-- string, so any venue whose own NAME contains " - " loses its second half into the city:
--
--   'Bank Of America Performing Arts Center - Fred Kavli Theatre - Thousand Oaks, CA'
--      venue -> 'Bank Of America Performing Arts Center'
--      city  -> 'Fred Kavli Theatre - Thousand Oaks'        <- not a city
--
-- That is a live miss, not a cosmetic one: Vivid production 7049102 (Theresa Caputo,
-- 2027-01-28) has exactly ONE TEvo candidate at that venue on that day (3435368) and was
-- declined because rule 1 was handed a venue the mirror does not know. Greedy `.*` anchors on
-- the LAST " - " instead, which is where the generated suffix always is.
--
-- Blast radius, measured on the whole book: 26 of 448 distinct Vivid venue strings change,
-- and they are exactly the ones with " - " inside the venue name. The city/state groups keep
-- their own `.*?` -> `.*` change for the same reason; they must agree with the venue group or
-- a row would get one half of one reading and one half of the other.
--
-- Everything else in event_mapper_surface_sql is carried forward verbatim from prod.
